i like this dress a lot, but it would have required tailoring the skirt. i'm petite, but for whatever reason most regular sized clothing fit me well, and petites clothes are usually too short in the arms or legs for me. the midi length is better suited to taller women. in the photo it looks like it hits just below the model's knee, but on me it hit below the fullest part of my calf.

377,56,Pure perfection,This is a great top. i almost walked right by it because it is so simplistic compared to the other things in retailer. i just wanted something super casual and this fits the bill. the fabric is a dream and it has a nice drape without being overly voluminous. i usually love white tops but the white was my least favorite. i ended up getting the moss and the gray. i could have gotten either the xs or the s. i went with the small because it was a little longer and had a wee bit more room in the upper,5,1,3,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge
